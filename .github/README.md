Web Check - A browser based website info tool, pretty fricken awesome, "There are many like this but this one is mine." 

If you want to see complete data and tutorial/description with extra stuff (some of the data in the original repo is extensive, personally, if you needed to know that much info about what this site does, you shouldn't be using it...but to each there own) Then go see

I used Netlify which worked flawlessly with how Lissy93 set this up, so thanks for that!
